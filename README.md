This file contains a resource of data from a coffee selling company 
Downlaoded from Mo Chen's excel tutorials on youtube 
I used XLOOKUPS throughout the project to join the tables for easy data manipulation 
Used formulae to find find total sales 
Applied the results to Pivot table 
Extracted pivot table data to build charts for easy data interpretation 
Added Slicers to further break the interpretaion into relevant areas
